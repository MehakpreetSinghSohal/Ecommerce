  "description": "Ever since the Steam Deck first released, Valve fans have been wondering whether the console would get an OLED upgrade similar to what the Nintendo Switch received. Valve has previously been hush-hush about the possibility, but more and more evidence has been popping up for an OLED model over the past few months, making it seem very likely. Now, Valve has randomly decided to pull back the curtain and reveal that an OLED Steam Deck is not only happening, it’s happening really soon.",
